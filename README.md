# parsedmarc-dockerized

Note: The standalone `parsedmarc` docker image on [DockerHub @ patschi/parsedmarc](https://hub.docker.com/r/patschi/parsedmarc) can also be used, if interested.

## Setup:
1. Get basics together:
```
git clone https://github.com/patschi/parsedmarc-dockerized.git /opt/parsedmarc-dockerized/
cd /opt/parsedmarc-dockerized/ && cp data/conf/parsedmarc/config.sample.ini data/conf/parsedmarc/config.ini
```

2. Next we change the `parsedmarc` config (see [docs](https://domainaware.github.io/parsedmarc/#configuration-file). You can set `Test` to `True` for testing purposes.)
```
nano data/conf/parsedmarc/config.ini
```

3. Now we need to create a `docker-compose.override.yml` with the following content:

```
version: '3.9'

services:
  nginx:
    ports:
      - "9999:443"
    volumes:
      - ./data/conf/nginx/site.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
      - ./data/conf/nginx/ssl/:/etc/nginx/ssl/:ro
```

4. Now we create an environment file, containing your geoipupdate settings from your [MaxMind account](https://www.maxmind.com/en/account/) to allow the container to pull the databases. For update cycles of the databases, please see [here](https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-faq/geoip2-and-geoip-legacy-database-updates/how-often-are-the-geoip2-and-geoip-legacy-databases-updated/). (Fill in your data!)
```
cat > geoipupdate.env <<EOF
GEOIPUPDATE_ACCOUNT_ID=HERE_GOES_YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY=HERE_GOES_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
GEOIPUPDATE_FREQUENCY=24
EOF
```

5. Finally, we start up the stack and wait:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

### What's happening then?

1. First, containers of the stack are created and started. This might take a while, as several containers have dependencies on others being in a healthy state (meaning that its service must be fully started).
2. During the startup of the `parsedmarc-init` container, all required steps and preparations are being taken care of - like generating a self-signed certificate for the included `nginx` webserver.
3. Once the Kibana container - where you can view the dashboards - is started up, the corresponding parsedmarc dashboards are automatically imported into Kibana by the `parsedmarc-init` container.
4. After some while, when everything is up and running, you can then access Kibana and its dashboards under the shipped reverse proxy at `https://HOST_IP:9999`. (Make sure to use HTTPS!)

## Setup with Traefik:
1. Get basics together:
```
git clone https://github.com/patschi/parsedmarc-dockerized.git /opt/parsedmarc-dockerized/
cd /opt/parsedmarc-dockerized/ && cp data/conf/parsedmarc/config.sample.ini data/conf/parsedmarc/config.ini
```

2. Next we change the `parsedmarc` config (see [docs](https://domainaware.github.io/parsedmarc/#configuration-file). You can set `Test` to `True` for testing purposes.)
```
nano data/conf/parsedmarc/config.ini
```

3. Now we need to create a `docker-compose.override.yml` with the following content:

```
version: '3.9'
services:
  kibana:
    environment:
      SERVER_PUBLICBASEURL: https://yourdomain.com
  nginx:
    volumes:
      - ./data/conf/nginx/traefik.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
    labels:
      traefik.docker.network: proxy
      traefik.enable: "true"
      traefik.http.routers.parsedmarc-secure.entrypoints: websecure
      traefik.http.routers.parsedmarc-secure.middlewares: default@file
      traefik.http.routers.parsedmarc-secure.rule: Host(`yourdomain.com`)
      traefik.http.routers.parsedmarc-secure.service: parsedmarc
      traefik.http.routers.parsedmarc-secure.tls: "true"
      traefik.http.routers.parsedmarc-secure.tls.certresolver: http
      traefik.http.services.parsedmarc.loadbalancer.server.port: "80"
    networks:
      proxy: null
networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
```

Please note that the Traefik configuration needs to be adjusted according to your own needs. Similarly, the domain should be changed accordingly to match your setup.
